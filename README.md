## Getting Started

- I use next js as a framework due to my experience using it in the first place, and because I can really think of using reactjs with nextjs :D.

- but also using the static generated page that nextjs provide allow me to make the result be faster and stable and reduce API call every time user opens the app for the first 15 repositories to be viewed.

- sass as styling preprocessors.

-to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

-and to run the production server :
need to build the app first :

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

and then start the production server by :

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
